This project, Alien Invasion, is a game created from scratch. In Alien Invasion, the player controls a ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the playerâ€™s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends. I used the PyGame library extensively in order to create the game. The game was also built incrementally, using Git and Github to keep separate versions.
